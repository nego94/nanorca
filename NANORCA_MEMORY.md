## 1. What Is This Project

NANORCA is an autonomous crypto trading bot built with:
- **Python AI brain** — Claude Haiku or claude sonet when needed makes trading decisions
- **Go executor** — fast exchange I/O, WebSocket feeds, order execution
- **PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB** — trade history, signal weights, learning data
- **Prometheus + Grafana** — real-time dashboard at `https://nanorca.creativorium.com`
- **Telegram bot** — trade alerts + command interface

**Architecture:** Python ↔ gRPC ↔ Go ↔ Binance/Hyperliquid/Polymarket

## 2. Current Phase

### Phase: 1 — Paper Trading (LOCAL)
**Status:** Running on owner's laptop via Docker Desktop

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Paper trading mode | ✅ ACTIVE (`PAPER_TRADING=true`) |
| Real Binance futures wallet funded | ✅ $11.39 USDT-M |
| Data collection | ✅ 24/7 on VPS (Hostinger KVM2, 72.62.124.23) |
| VPS deployment | ✅ LIVE since 2026-05-14 03:02 UTC |
| Win rate baseline | ⏳ Accumulating — check back in 7-14 days |
| First weekly learning | ⏳ Sunday 2026-05-18 00:00 UTC |
| Grafana dashboard | ✅ https://nanorca.creativorium.com (working as of 2026-05-14) |
| Live trading | 🔒 LOCKED until 14-day paper win rate ≥ 60% |

**What the bot does right now:**
1. Scans top-25 Binance USDT futures pairs by volume every 60 seconds
2. Pre-filter checks if any signal crosses threshold before calling Claude
3. If market is quiet → skips Claude call (saves API cost)
4. If signals fire → calls Claude Haiku → gets trading decision
5. If confidence ≥ 55 → sizes position by confidence tier → paper executes
6. All paper trades logged to PostgreSQL

---

## 3. Capital Reality

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Binance spot USDT | $0.00 (transferred to futures) |
| Binance USDT-M Futures | $11.39 |
| Locked coins (other) | ~$0.64 |
| Portfolio total | ~$12.04 |
| Bot tradeable capital | **$11.39** |

**Capital bucket system:**
- **Tradeable** = USDT-M futures wallet → bot sizes trades from this
- **Locked** = other coins in spot → bot tracks for display, never trades
- **In-flight** = USDT tied up in open positions right now

**Minimum viable capital for Phase 2 (live):** $300–500

## 5. Trading Logic — Decision Pipeline

Every 60 seconds:
```
1. Bot state check          → skip if paused/stopped
2. Capital floor check      → emergency stop if < 25% of starting capital
3. Daily loss check         → pause if daily loss > 8%
4. Market scan              → Go executor fetches top-25 Binance USDT pairs every 30s (incl. BTC/ETH for direction)
                               WebSocket feeds live bid/ask data between cycles
5. Auto-close positions     → stop-loss (-2%) or max hold (4h) trigger
6. Build signals            → momentum, volume spike, funding rate, price gap
7. Pre-filter               → skip Claude if: momentum < 0.30% AND volume < 1.20x AND funding < 0.01%
8. MIN_GROSS_MOVE check     → skip if momentum < 0.09% (can't cover 0.04% round-trip fee)
9. Call Claude Haiku        → get: action, market, direction, size_pct, confidence, reasoning,
                               target_profit_pct, stop_loss_pct, spot_suggestion
                               Claude reads BTC/ETH as market direction, trades only altcoins
10. Spot suggestion check   → if active + conf ≥ 65 → send Telegram (NOT executed)
11. Confidence gate:
    < 50  → hard skip, nothing logged
    50-64 → add to SuggestionStore → surfaced via /markets (BTC/ETH filtered out)
    65+   → proceed to trade
12. Open position count     → skip if 3 positions already open (MAX_OPEN_POSITIONS=3)
13. Risk manager approval   → graduated sizing + leverage cap + exposure check
14. Execute (paper or live) → Go executor PlaceOrder
15. Broadcast Telegram      → formatted FUTURES: LONG/SHORT open notification
16. Log to DB               → trades table, outcome_logger
```

---

## 6. Confidence → Action (Updated)

| Confidence | Action | Size |
|---|---|---|
| < 50 | Hard skip — nothing logged | 0% |
| 50–64 | **Suggestion only** — surfaced via /markets, NOT traded | 0% |
| 65–79 | Trade — normal | 3% of capital |
| 80–89 | Trade — full | 5% of capital |
| 90+ | Trade — max + high_conviction flag | 5% of capital |

**Why 50–64 is now suggestions instead of 1% trades:**
The human checks `/markets` or `/readmarkets` and can manually act on these.
The bot does not risk capital on low-confidence signals. Learning data
comes from the 65+ trades only.

---

## 7. Fee Model (Why Futures Only)

| Trade type | Fee | Round-trip | Min gross move needed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spot | 0.10%/side | 0.20% | 0.25%+ (not viable for 30-min holds) |
| Futures maker (GTX) | 0.02%/side | 0.04% | **0.09%** ✅ |

Bot ALWAYS uses futures limit orders with `timeInForce=GTX` (Post-Only).
Never market orders. Never spot for short-term holds.

---

## 8. Telegram Commands

| Command | Access | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/status` | All | Bot state, capital, mode, open positions |
| `/capital` | All | Tradeable USDT, locked coins, portfolio breakdown |
| `/positions` | All | Current open positions with entry/size |
| `/markets` | All | Market suggestions (50–64 conf) + live top prices |
| `/readmarkets` | All | Alias for `/markets` — same output |
| `/report` | All | Today's P&L, win rate, trade count |
| `/history` | All | Last 10 closed trades |
| `/learning` | All | Last weekly learning report |
| `/help` | All | Command list |
| `/pause` | Owner | Pause trading (keeps positions open) |
| `/resume` | Owner | Resume trading |
| `/setfloor N` | Owner | Change capital floor % |
| `/setmode` | Owner | Change trading plan mode |
| `/stop` | Owner | Emergency stop exchange |

---

## 9. Telegram Broadcast Format

### Trade opened (futures):
```
📊 [📄 PAPER] FUTURES: LONG - SOLUSDT
─────────────────────
📍 Open @$149.82
🎯 Target: +0.5% → $150.57
🛑 Stop: -2.0% → $146.82
💰 Size: $0.34 (3.0% of capital)
🧠 Confidence: 72/100
⏱ Expected hold: 90 min
📋 SOL momentum +0.47% over 8 min, volume 1.3x baseline
📈 Positions open: 1/3
```

### Trade closed:
```
✅ WIN [📄 PAPER] FUTURES: LONG - SOLUSDT CLOSED
─────────────────────
📍 Entry: $149.82 → Exit: $150.65
💰 P&L: +$0.28 (+0.55%)
⏱ Hold: 87 min
🔖 Closed by: stop-loss / max-hold (240m)
💳 Fees: $0.0001
```

### Spot suggestion (manual only):
```
💡 SPOT SUGGESTION [📄 PAPER]
─────────────────────
SPOT: LONG - SOLUSDT
🗓 Hold: 3-4 weeks
🎯 Target date: 2026-06-10
🧠 Confidence: 71/100
📋 SOL breaking key resistance, volume accumulation pattern
⚠️ Manual action only — bot does NOT execute spot trades
```

## 10. Active Exchanges & Market Roles

| Exchange | Trading | Intelligence | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| Binance USDT-M Futures | ✅ Active | ✅ Market scanner | Phase 2+ |
| Hyperliquid | ❌ Disabled | ✅ Funding rate signal | Phase 3 |
| Polymarket | ❌ Disabled | ✅ Price gap signal | Phase 3 |

### BTC and ETH — Analysis Only, Never Traded

**Critical distinction (user confirmed 2026-05-14):**

| Role | BTC | ETH | Altcoins (SOL/BNB/INJ etc.) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scanned for price/volume | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Used as market direction signal | ✅ Yes — primary | ✅ Yes — secondary | Used as trade targets |
| In PRIORITY_MARKETS | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Suggested for trading | ❌ Never | ❌ Never | ✅ These are traded |
| In suggestion store (50-64 conf) | ❌ Filtered out | ❌ Filtered out | ✅ Shown |

**Why BTC/ETH are kept in analysis:**
- BTC momentum tells Claude the overall crypto market direction
- If BTC +1% → market bullish → increases confidence in altcoin LONG signals
- If BTC -2% → market risk-off → reduces confidence in any LONG, increases SHORT bias
- ETH momentum signals DeFi and Layer-1 sentiment specifically

**Why BTC/ETH are excluded from trading:**
- BTCUSDT min futures lot = 0.001 BTC ≈ $100+ (too large for $11 capital)
- ETHUSDT: lower % daily moves than altcoins → less profit per unit of risk at small capital
- Rule: when capital > $500, reassess whether to add ETH trading

---

## 11. Environment Variables (Key Ones)

```bash
PAPER_TRADING=true              # NEVER set false without 14-day paper proof
SCAN_INTERVAL_SECONDS=60        # Phase 2 lean: use 90-120
ENABLED_EXCHANGES=binance       # Add hyperliquid,polymarket in Phase 3
BINANCE_SCAN_TOP_N=20           # Top 20 USDT pairs by 24h volume
PRIORITY_MARKETS=ETH,SOL,BNB,DOGE,ADA,AVAX,INJ,LINK,DOT,OP  # No BTC (min lot too big)
TRADING_MODE=hybrid             # aggressive for <$1k, conservative for >$10k
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=65         # Used in Claude prompt context
MIN_GROSS_MOVE_PCT=0.09         # Fee break-even gate
MAX_POSITION_PCT=20             # % of capital per trade (high for $12 testing)
CAPITAL_FLOOR_PCT=25            # Emergency stop level
```

## 11b. Future Feature: Dynamic Priority Markets + /check TOKEN

### What was requested (not yet implemented)
The user wants:
1. Priority markets to be **dynamic** — auto-updated based on trending/high-volume coins from each scan cycle, not the static `.env` list
2. `/check TOKEN/USDT` — manually add a coin to priority list for deeper scanning
3. **Max 15 priority slots** — when full and user adds a new one, bot asks which to remove
4. **History** — remember which coins were removed and when, with reason

### Implementation plan (Phase 4 or later)
```
/check INJUSDT
→ Bot: "INJUSDT added to priority scan. Priority list now 8/15:
        [ETH, SOL, BNB, DOGE, ADA, AVAX, LINK, INJ]"

/check APTUSDT  (when at 15 limit)
→ Bot: "Priority list is full (15/15). Which would you remove?
        Least active in last 7 days: DOTUSDT (0 signals, last scanned 3d ago)
        Type /removepriority DOTUSDT to confirm."

/removepriority DOTUSDT
→ Bot: "DOTUSDT removed. Reason: replaced by APTUSDT on 2026-05-20.
        APTUSDT added. Priority: 15/15."
```

### Dynamic auto-update (Phase 5+)
Every Sunday during weekly learning:
- Scanner ranks all 25 top markets by signal quality (win rate × volume × momentum variance)
- Top 10 auto-replace lowest-performing 10 priority slots
- User gets Telegram report: "Priority updated: removed [X, Y] added [A, B]"

### Storage needed
- `priority_markets` table in PostgreSQL: symbol, added_at, added_by (user/auto), removed_at, removed_reason
- Currently: static list in `.env` — acceptable for Phase 1

## 12. Known Issues & Limitations

| Issue | Impact | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Momentum signal resets on restart | Takes 5-10 min to warm up after each Docker restart | Persist price history to DB (Phase 4) |
| No 24/7 operation on laptop | Can't collect 14-day paper baseline | **Move to VPS** (Hetzner $3.50/mo or dihostingin.com Ryzen-1) |
| Position lost on executor restart | Open positions vanish from in-memory state | Persist positions to DB (Phase 4) |
| BTC excluded from trading | BTCUSDT min lot ~$100, too big for $11 capital | Resolved: prompt tells Claude to avoid BTC |
| CMC/news signals not connected | Missing trend intelligence | Phase 3 — CMC_API_KEY exists in .env |
| Proto generation was incomplete | executor Dockerfile only generated pb.go not grpc.pb.go → `UnimplementedExecutorServiceServer` undefined | Fixed: now installs protoc-gen-go-grpc and generates both files |
| /check TOKEN not implemented | User couldn't add custom coins to scan | Fixed: ExtraMarketsStore + /check /listpriority /removepriority commands; scanner unions user list with top-25 |
| Open trades stuck in DB after restart | exchange_order_id not saved to DB; _open_trades dict lost on restart → trades never closed → win rate never builds | Fixed: exchange_order_id persisted to DB; recover_from_db() on startup expires stale (>4h) trades and reloads recent ones |
| Fear & Greed Index not connected | Missing macro sentiment signal | Phase 3 |
| Weekly learning not run yet | Signal weights still at defaults | Will auto-run next Sunday 00:00 UTC |

---

## 13. Deployment Phases

## 14. VPS Setup (When Ready)

**Recommended:** dihostingin.com Ryzen-1 (2GB RAM, 40GB NVMe, Ryzen 9 7950x3D)
OR Hetzner ARM64 Frankfurt ($3.50/mo)

**Setup steps:**
```bash
# On VPS after SSH login:
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
sudo apt-get install -y docker-compose-plugin

# Add 2GB swap (required for 2GB RAM VPS):
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile && sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile && sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Deploy:
git clone https://github.com/nego94/nanorca.git
cd nanorca
# Copy .env from local machine via scp (never commit .env)
sudo ufw allow 22 && sudo ufw allow 3000 && sudo ufw enable
docker compose up -d

# Access Grafana: https://nanorca.creativorium.com (or http://72.62.124.23:3000 direct)
# NPM admin: http://72.62.124.23:81
```

**PostgreSQL tuning for 2GB RAM** (add to docker-compose.yml postgres service):
```yaml
command: >
  postgres
  -c shared_buffers=256MB
  -c effective_cache_size=512MB
  -c work_mem=16MB
  -c maintenance_work_mem=64MB
```

## 17. Next Immediate Actions

1. **Set up VPS** (laptop can't run 24/7 for 14-day paper baseline)
2. **Watch first paper trade** fire on Telegram (market needs to move > 0.30%)
3. **Check Sunday learning report** — first auto-run next Sunday 00:00 UTC
4. **Monitor daily** via `/report` command on Telegram
5. **When win rate ≥ 60% over 14+ days** → flip `PAPER_TRADING=false`
